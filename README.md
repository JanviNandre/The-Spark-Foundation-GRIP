# Internship-Tasks
These are the tasks given to in the Data Science internship with The Sparks Foundation GRIP(Graduate Rotational Internship Program )

# Task1
## Prediction using Supervised ML 
● Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.

● What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

● This is a simple linear  regression task as it involves just 2 variables.

● Dataset : http://bit.ly/w-data 

# Task 2
## Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm 
● Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. 

● The purpose is if we feed any new data to this  classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
